# Goal

- Explore generic study designs for SID data

--

- Go from full SID data to subset containing *primary inclusion criterion*

--

  - Usually consists of diagnoses/procedures

--

  - From this smaller data set, more specific inclusion/exclusion criteria can be applied, and that information can be reported in a cohort flow diagram


---


# Patient- vs Admission-level

- What is the unit of analysis?

--

- Admission-level analysis uses all records that meet inclusion/exclusion criteria

--

  - Cannot define baseline covariates / outcomes outside of index admissions
  
  - Similar to an analysis using the NIS database
  
--

- Patient-level analysis starts with all records that meet inclusion/exclusion criteria but then chooses one record per patient, typically the earliest

--

  - Can use other records associated with these patients for baseline covariates / outcomes

# Considerations

- Choice of design is influenced by multiple factors

--

- Admission-level design is more straightforward to code

--

  - Individual records do not provide much information about timing of events
  
  - Limits the types of conclusions that can be made

--

- (Longitudinal) patient-level design requires more coding

--

  - More planning required to keep track of multiple data sets
  
  - Allows a larger set of potential outcomes
